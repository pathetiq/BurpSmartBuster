<p>This extension discovers content with a smart touch. A
bit like "DirBuster" and "Burp Discover Content", but smarter. The plugin looks at words in pages, the domain name,
the current directories and filename to help you find hidden files, directories
and information you usually don't with a static dictionary file that brute
forces its way on the web server.</p>
